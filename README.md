## Project Overview For Ride Sharing 

## This analysis will address disparities found through analysis of the studies ride-sharing data 

What we are seeking to provide in our analysis is an overview of ride sharing in a variety of populations and the cost associated in each city. Data was collected throughout numerous cities focusing on different areas we define as urban, suburban, and rural. We are looking to provide useful data for the allocation of drivers and committed resources to increase overall profits.  

Our results show that there are a considerably higher concentration of drivers in studied urban areas compared to both suburan and rural locations. It was interesting to note that the fares were higher in both suburban and rural areas weighed against the urban fares. One could surmise that the lower fares are due to shorter distances traveled as most urban areas are densely populated, but cover a shorter travel distance to get to a desired destination. Where a rural rider most likely willtravel great distance to get to their destination increasing the fare a driver could charge to provide the service.

Charts will be provided upon requests. 

Based on our analysis, we recommend the following to the executive staff for their consideration:

1. Commit new driver resources to populated urban areas to maximize coverage and profit

2. Advertise in suburban areas, possibly implement more coupons for ride-sharing to child friendly activities to focus on family needs

3. Concentrate larger vehicles and van service to rural areas with promotions to entice riders going to ariports and hospitals to accomodate the potential demographic in need of ride share from those targeted areas
